  description:
    "My name is Peter Ebueku. I have been building professional software for two years, but I have been solving real-world problems for much longer. I can develop both front-end and back-end applications, though I particularly enjoy working on the server-side. I have worked on several financial applications, using languages like TypeScript, Golang, and Rust for the back end, and Vue.js, Nuxt, and Quasar for the front end. I am currently expanding my knowledge by exploring cloud computing with AWS.",
